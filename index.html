        <h1>Understanding Australia's Agriculture Production</h1>

        <!-- Agriculture Map Title -->

            <p class="description">Visualise regional agricultural production across Australia's diverse commodities. Looking at the production of Potatoes we can see that majority of production comes from Victoria and South Australia, but we can note that South Australia was not always a big producer of Potatoes.</p>

            <div class="description-right">
                <p>Compare multiple commodities to assess their production strengths visually. To give insight since Victoria and New South Wales are close to each other we can expect them to have similar production however we do note that Maize is produced in larger quantities in New South Wales.</p>

            <div id="bubble"></div>
            <p class="description">Observe relationships between commodities, production values, and regions clearly. We can see that as the amount of land used for agriculture increases the amount of production also increases, we can also conclude that Wheat is Australia's biggest commodity production.</p>

        <!-- Line Chart Title -->
        <div class="title-container">

            <div class="description-right">
                <p>Track production trends over time for key agricultural commodities. We can see that across Commodities that Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania have lower prodution comapred to the rest of the states, this could be due to lower land size as well as land constraints making agriculture hard.</p>

        <div class="visualization two-column">
            <div class="chart" id="scatter"></div>
            <div class="description-right">
                <p>Analyse correlation between production and year across commodities effectively. A general trend we can see is that as hectares increase the production will increase accordingly. From this we can also see that New South Wales invests more land for agriculture which results in higher production of commodities compared to other states.</p>
